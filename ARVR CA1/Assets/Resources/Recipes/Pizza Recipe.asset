  _instructions: "Pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve the yeast
    with a fork.\r\n\nAdd 1 cup of flour, all of the cornmeal, salt, and vegetable
    oil, and mix well with a spoon.\r\n\r\nContinue stirring in the rest of the flour
    1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl.\r\n\r\nFlour
    your hands and the work surface and knead the ball of dough until it is no longer
    sticky.\r\n\nLet the dough rise in an oiled bowl, sealed with plastic wrap, for
    45-60 minutes in a warm place, until it has doubled in size.\r\n\r\nPunch it
    down and knead it briefly.\r\n\r\nPress it into an oiled 15-inch deep dish pizza
    pan until it comes 2 inches up the sides and is even on the bottom of the pan.\r\n\r\nLet
    the dough rise 15-20 minutes before filling.\r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 500\xB0F.\n\r\nWhile
    the dough is rising, prepare the filling.\r\n\r\nWhen the dough has finished
    its second rising, lay the cheese over the dough shell.\r\nDistribute the pepperoni
    and garlic over the cheese.\r\nTop with the tomato sauce.\r\n\r\nSprinkle on
    the seasonings and Parmesan cheese.\r\n\r\nBake for 15 minutes at 500\xB0F, then
    lower the temperature to 400\xB0F and finish baking for 25-35 minutes longer.\r\n\r\nLift
    up a section of the crust from time to time with a spatula to check its color.\r\n\r\nThe
    crust will be golden brown when done.\r\n\r\nServe immediately."
